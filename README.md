# Dream Art

This repository provides a Dockerfile to run [inceptionism/DeepDream][inceptionism]
and "[A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style][neural-art-arxiv]" with
the following repositories.

+ [jcjohnson/neural-style][neural-style]
+ [eladhoffer/DeepDream.torch][DeepDream.torch]

The following examples were created with [create-outputs.sh](/create-outputs.sh)
and show an input content image followed by the DeepDream content image,
and then pairs of input artistic styles and
the DeepDream content image with the style applied.
See [the gallery](/gallery.md) for more examples.

# How can I use this on my images without downloading anything?

Tweet the style and source image to
[@brandondamos](https://twitter.com/brandondamos)
with the hashtag `#DreamArtRequest` and I'll manually
generate images for you.
If there's enough interest, I'll create a bot to
automatically process images with `#DreamArtRequest`
on my server.

# Inceptionism (DeepDream)

*Inceptionism* is introduced in
[Google Research's blog post](http://googleresearch.blogspot.ch/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html)
and visualizes an
[artificial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)
by enhancing input images to elicit an interpretation.
The following example from the blog post.
See [the original gallery](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPX0SCl7OzWilt9LnuQliattX4OUCj_8EP65_cTVnBmS1jnYgsGQAieQUc1VQWdgQ?key=aVBxWjhwSzg2RjJWLWRuVFBBZEN1d205bUdEMnhB)
or [#DeepDream](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DeepDream) for more examples.

The current implementations are
[google/deepdream][deepdream] which uses [Caffe][caffe] and
[eladhoffer/DeepDream.torch][DeepDream.torch] which uses [Torch][torch].

# A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style
'[A Neural Algorthm of Artistic Style][neural-art-arxiv]' is a paper by
Leon Gatys, Alexander Ecker, and Matthias Bethge released as
a preprint on August 26, 2015.
The current implementations are
[jcjohnson/neural-style][neural-style] and
[kaishengtai/neuralart][neural-art], which
both use [Torch][torch].

# Can't I just run the implementations separately? What does this repository provide?
Nontrivial toolchains and system configuration make the barrier to
running current implementations high.
This repository lowers the barrier by combining
[DeepDream.torch][DeepDream.torch] with
[neural-style][neural-style] into Torch applications application that share the
same model and run on the CPU and GPU.

Ideally, both of these implementations should ship on [luarocks](https://luarocks.org)
and provide a command-line interface and library that
nicely load the models.
When they do, this repository will be obsolete, but until then,
this repository glues them together and provides a Dockerfile to
simplify deployment.

# Setup
Some portions below are from [jcjohnson/neural-style][neural-style].

## Check out git submodules
Clone with `--recursive` or run `git submodule init && git submodule update`
after checking out.

## Download the VGG Model
Run `./models/download_models.sh` to download the original
[VGG-19 model](https://gist.github.com/ksimonyan/3785162f95cd2d5fee77#file-readme-md).
Leon Gatys has graciously provided the modified version of the VGG-19
model that was used in their paper;
this will also be downloaded.
By default the original VGG-19 model is used.

This model is shared between DeepDream and NeuralStyle.

## With Docker

DreamArt can be deployed as a container with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
for CPU mode:

```
./models/download_models.sh
sudo docker build -t dream-art .
sudo docker run -t -i -v $PWD:/dream-art dream-art /bin/bash
cd /dream-art
th ./deepdream.lua -gpu -1 -content_image ./examples/inputs/golden_gate.jpg -output_image golden_gate_deepdream.png
./neural-style.sh -gpu -1 -content_image ./golden_gate_deepdream.png -style_image ./examples/inputs/starry_night.jpg -output_image golden_gate_deepdream_starry.png
```

To use, place your images in `dream-art` on your host and
access them from the shared Docker directory.

## By hand
Dependencies:
* [torch7](https://github.com/torch/torch7)
* [loadcaffe](https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe)

Optional dependencies:
* CUDA 6.5+
* [cudnn.torch](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch)

# Other Q&A

+ **How long does it take to process a single image?**
  This depends on the neural network model, image size,
  and number of iterations.
  On average, DeepDream takes about 5 minutes and
  the art takes about 15 minutes on a GPU.
+ **How much memory does this use?**
  This also depends on the neural network model, image size,
  and number of iterations.
  On average, both consume about 4GB of memory.
